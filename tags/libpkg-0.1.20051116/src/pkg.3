.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Package
A package is represented by a
.Tn struct pkg
which is normaly created by a Package Repository or
Package Database.
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Fn pkg_new
Allocates and initializes an empty
.Tn struct pkg
object. It takes in the packages name, and three callbacks
to read the control files, read the next content file and
free all data respectively.
These callbacks can be NULL if they are unneeded.
.It Fn pkg_new_freebsd
Creates a new package with callbacks to handle FreeBSD
packages version 1.1
.It Fn pkg_make_freebsd
Converts an empty package to a FreeBSD package.
The
.Vt fd
must point to a file that is a correct FreeBSD package.
.It Fn pkg_get_name
Returns the name of a package
.Vt pkg .
.It Fn pkg_get_dependencies
Returns an array of pointers to
.Vt pkg
objects of packages that the current package depends on.
The package objects are almost empty with just the name set so need to be retrieced from a repository with
.Xr pkg_repo_find_pkg 3 .
.It Fn pkg_get_control_files
Returns all control files from the package.
Eg. The `+' files in /var/db/pkg/package/ from FreeBSD Packages.
.It Fn pkg_get_next_file
Gets the next non-control file from the package.
.It Fn pkg_free
Frees all allocated space from a package and calls the
package free callback.
.El
.Ss Package File
The
.Tn struct pkg_file
containes one file.
It can be installed or processed further.
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Fn pkg_file_new_from_buffer
Creates a
.Tn struct pkg_file
from a NULL-terminated buffer. If
.Vt sb
is non-NULL it will use it to set the correct permisions on
the file.
.It Fn pkg_file_write
writes the file pointed to by
.Vt file
to the correct place relative to the current directory.
.It Fn pkg_file_free
Frees a
.Tn struct pkg_file .
