libpkg is a library to fetch, install, remove and modify packages in a package management system.

It is initialy designed for FreeBSD but could be extended for any system.

libpkg has been developed and tested on FreeBSD.
To build libpkg type "make" in this directory. It will build the library and a demo program. The depo program will install a given package to ./fakeroot/

Pros:
    * It appears to be faster than using pkg_add because it extracts the files directly to the correct location rather than to a tempory location then copy to the correct location.
    * It is package format ignostic.

Problems:
    * It can only install packages not uninstall or create them.
    * Can't get a list of installed packages.
    * There is no dependency handling.
    * Dosn't follow style(9).
    * Not all possible lines in +CONTENTS are handled.
    * @exec lines in +CONTENTS aren't executed.
    * A failed install will leave files with no package.
